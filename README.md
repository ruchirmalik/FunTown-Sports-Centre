Welcome to Fun-Town Sports Center GitHub repository! üèÄ‚öΩüéæ

Explore the intersection of sports and technology with our project, where we've meticulously designed a robust database foundation for a sports center using an Entity-Relationship (E/R) diagram converted into a relational schema. To ensure optimal efficiency, we applied the BCNF normalization technique, recognizing functional dependencies and minimizing data redundancy.

The heart of our project lies in the development of a responsive website crafted with JavaScript, PHP, HTML, and CSS, coupled with MySQL for seamless data retrieval. Dive into the intricacies of TypeScript, PHP, HTML, and CSS as you explore the codebase, and witness the power of data normalization techniques in action.

One of our standout features is an appointment management system, providing coaches with the ability to create and delete appointments, while empowering members to view, book, and cancel appointments with various coaches. This comprehensive system includes administrative oversight, ensuring smooth and controlled operations.

Join us in the dynamic world of Fun-Town Sports Center, where sports and technology converge to create an immersive and efficient experience for all! üöÄ
